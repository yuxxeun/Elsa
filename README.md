## _Blue Jeans ㅡ this song for_ `you`.

_Calling you late at night
Talking bout nothin'
But we’re always laughing_

_These dumb conversations
They raise my affections
Those were the good times
And I miss the old times_

_Have I told you lately
That I miss you badly_

_Sometimes I wish
That I could still call you mine
Still call you mine
Now all I’ve got is
The stain on my blue jeans
The only way I could
Remember that you were once mine_

_Your voice were lullabies
I would be list’nin’
Till I was sleeping
But our situations
It stopped our relations
Why did we end it?
Don’t want to believe it_
