## _Blue Jeans ㅡ this song for_ `you`.

_Calling you late at night_<br>
_Talking bout nothin'_ <br>
_But we’re always laughing_

_These dumb conversations_ <br>
_They raise my affections_ <br>
_Those were the good times_ <br>
_And I miss the old times_

_Have I told you lately_ <br>
_That I miss you badly_

_Sometimes I wish_ <br>
_That I could still call you mine_ <br>
_Still call you mine_ <br>
_Now all I’ve got is_ <br>
_The stain on my blue jeans_ <br>
_The only way I could_ <br>
_Remember that you were once mine_

_Your voice were lullabies_ <br>
_I would be list’nin’_ <br>
_Till I was sleeping_ <br>
_But our situations_ <br>
_It stopped our relations_ <br>
_Why did we end it?_ <br>
_Don’t want to believe it_
